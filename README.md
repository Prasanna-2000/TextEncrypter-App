# TextEncrypter-App

Introduction :
Message encryptor is a simple app which converts the userâ€™s plain text into cypher text.
User should use a secret key to encrypt and decrypt the plain text or message they have entered.
Encryption is based on AES(Advanced Encryption Standard), which is one of the strongest encryption standard. And also by using MD5 hashing to check the integrity of the text.
AES is a military level encryption standard and widely used.
The app has a simple and minimalistic UI which the user can easily interact with.
The encrypted text then can be shared via other application by simply copying it to the clipboard.


AES encryption is achieved in this app by using scottyab api.
It's Simple API to perform AES encryption on Android. This is the Android counterpart to the AESCrypt library.

And MD5 hashing is done through MD5 MessageDigest class in android.
